# Risk Assessment and Vulnerability Remediation Project

I conducted a complete risk assessment on a simulated small business network environment. I built the entire infrastructure from scratch, deploying 9 endpoints (primarily Linux systems with 2 Windows machines), a Linux-based domain controller, an Apache web server hosting a deliberately vulnerable application, and a pfSense firewall. After configuring the domain controller to serve as the network's name server and setting up pfSense to handle DHCP and DNS services, I implemented a structured risk assessment methodology following the NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Framework and incorporating concepts from NIST SP 800-40 for enterprise patch management.

My risk assessment framework was highly detailed, utilizing a custom-designed risk matrix that rated vulnerabilities on a six-level scale from very low to extreme. I created an extensive risk register in Excel format with multiple tracking categories including Risk ID, Date Raised, Description, Asset Affected, Likelihood Rating, Impact Rating, Risk Score, Risk Action, Risk Treatment, Risk Owner, Status, Residual Risk, and Notes. The risk register utilized formulas to calculate risk scores by multiplying impact and likelihood ratings, which directly informed my prioritization decisions.

### **Risk Matrix**

The risk matrix used a 5x5 grid with likelihood ratings (Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain) crossed with impact ratings (Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, Severe), producing risk scores ranging from:

- **1-2:** Very Low (Green)
- **3-4:** Low (Green)
- **4-9:** Medium (Yellow)
- **10-12:** High (Orange)
- **13-16:** Very High (Red)
- **16+:** Extreme (Red)

### **Vulnerability Assessment**

Using Kali Linux, I set up and configured OpenVAS through the terminal and accessed its web GUI via Firefox. I developed custom scanning profiles tailored to different system types, including specific profiles for the Apache server, domain controller, Linux machines, and Windows systems. After running comprehensive vulnerability scans, I meticulously analyzed each report, documented findings in my risk register, and verified systems for false positives, noting these in my documentation. For the vulnerable web application, I conducted additional specialized assessment using OWASP ZAP to identify web-specific security issues.

### **Advanced Mitigation Strategies**

What separated my approach from a standard assessment was the implementation of sophisticated risk mitigation strategies. For the vulnerable Apache web server, I designed and implemented a screened subnet (DMZ) configuration that effectively isolated it from the internal network. I created specific firewall rules that allowed only necessary external traffic to reach the web server while preventing any lateral movement into the internal network. This network segmentation demonstrated my ability to apply defense-in-depth principles to protect critical assets.

#### **Network Segmentation Implementation**

The network architecture included:

- **Internal Network:** 192.168.1.0/24 subnet containing workstations and domain controller
- **Screen Subnet (DMZ):** 192.168.1.151/24 containing the Apache web server (AS01-1)
- **pfSense Firewall:** Central security enforcement point with custom rules
- **Router/Switch:** External connectivity through ISP

The DMZ isolation ensured that even if the web server was compromised, attackers could not pivot to internal resources.

### **Compensating Controls**

I also deployed and configured Snort IDS on the pfSense firewall as a compensating control for a specific Linux vulnerability that couldn't be directly remediated. This implementation required me to create custom rules to detect and block the malicious traffic patterns that could exploit the vulnerability, providing real-time visibility into network activity and adding an additional security layer. For systems approaching end-of-life, I documented avoidance strategies including OS update requirements and interim protection measures.

### **Validation and Documentation**

After implementing all security controls, I conducted follow-up vulnerability scans to validate the effectiveness of my remediations. I meticulously updated the risk register with post-remediation findings, adjusted risk scores based on the implemented controls, and documented residual risk levels. Through this comprehensive approach, I successfully reduced the network's overall vulnerability exposure while establishing a sustainable, documented risk management process that balanced technical security requirements with simulated business operations.

### **Post-Remediation Results**

The remaining medium severity findings are primarily related to the SSB store vulnerability on Linux machines, which was addressed by implementing a compensating control where pfSense firewall rules and permission adjustments were made to mitigate this vulnerability.

It is also evident that follow-up scans were performed on only five machines as opposed to the eight initially scanned machines. Due to the lack of support for Windows 8, Windows XP, and, more recently, Windows 10, these machines were moved to the disposal and replacement stage in the asset management lifecycle as they posed a significant risk due to the lack of support from Microsoft.
